How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	R = First commnad git log display a list when identify id for specific commit and id the previous commit a need in the commmand git diff, because git diff need a id new commit and id old commit = git diff #id_new_commit #id_old_or_previous_commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
